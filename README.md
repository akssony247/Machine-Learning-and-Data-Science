# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science

These projects give application knowledge of algorithms like KNN, Perceptron as well as neural networks on some simple 2 class classification as well as some relatively complex problems such as image recognition(here we are only classifying digits from their images). We also plot the decision boundaries for these and discuss the different performance metrics and features about each in the word documents.
